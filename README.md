Community curated and predicted equivalences and related mappings between named biological entities
that are not available from primary sources.

Equivalences and related mappings that are available from the OBO Foundry and other
primary sources can be accessed through [Inspector Javert's Xref Database](https://zenodo.org/record/3757266)
on Zenodo which was described in [this blog post](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/19/inspector-javerts-xref-database.html).
